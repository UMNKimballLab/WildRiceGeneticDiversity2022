There were several versions of sample keys used across analyses. The original sample key that still included samples that were later excluded due to quality is [191021_main_GBS_sample_key_PBML-C20_renamed.csv](191021_main_GBS_sample_key_PBML-C20_renamed.csv). The full list of all samples used for any analyses is [Full_Sample_Key_240122.xlsx](Full_Sample_Key_240122.xlsx). 

The sample key [Updated_Sample_Key_230822.csv](Updated_Sample_Key_230822.csv) excludes 2010 temporal samples but still contains some samples that were later excluded from analyses. The key [SampleKey_Notemporal_240205.csv](SampleKey_Notemporal_240205.csv) excludes temporal samples as well as other samples excluded for quailty reasons, whereas the key [SampleKey_OnlyTemporal_240205.csv](SampleKey_OnlyTemporal_240205.csv) contains only temporal samples. The key [Sample_Key_with_cultivated_231003.csv](Sample_Key_with_cultivated_231003.csv) separates cultivated into germplasm names rather than grouping them as breeding lines, which was necessary for some analyses. 

The text files [breeding_lines.txt](breeding_lines.txt) and [natural_stands.txt](natural_stands.txt) are lists of samples that are either from breeding lines or natural stands, respectively.
