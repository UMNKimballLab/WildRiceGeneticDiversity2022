The Rscript [AMOVA.R](AMOVA.R) conducts the Analysis of Molecular Variance analysis. The R script uses the [```poppr.amova()```](https://search.r-project.org/CRAN/refmans/poppr/html/poppr.amova.html) function from the [_poppr_](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/poppr/index.html) R package. We used the "farthest neighbor" algorithm because it is the most strict option. The ```poppr.amova()``` function gives users the choice between the [_ade4_](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ade4/index.html) implementation or the [_pegas_](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pegas/index.html) implementation. We chose to use the _ade4_ implementation. To correct for non-Euclidean distance, we used the ```quasieuclid``` correction. We chose this over the ```lingoes``` or ```cailliez``` correction methods because ```quasieuclid``` does not introduce a modification of the original distances like the other two methods. The [AMOVA.R](AMOVA.R) script is launched using the shell script [run_AMOVA.sh](run_AMOVA.sh). The cultivated vs cultivated AMOVA was re-run using the script [AMOVA_cultvcult.R](AMOVA_cultvcult.R) because a deviation in the sample number was noted from the original.
