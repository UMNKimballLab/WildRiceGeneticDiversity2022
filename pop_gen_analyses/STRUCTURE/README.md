Data for this figure as well as figure S4 were organized for input into structure in the script [Organize_data_forStructure.R](Organize_data_forStructure.R). Data was then run through STRUCTURE using the parameters described in that script. As multiple runs of each K value were conducted, runs for each K value were aligned as described in the script [Aligning STRUCTURE runs within K values](Aligning-STRUCTURE-runs-within-K-values). Merged runs were then plotted with pophelper as described in the script [pophelper_plotting.R](pophelper_plotting.R)
