Nucleotide diversity was estimated using a variety of measures. Tajima's D, Genome-wide FST, and XP-CLR values were calculated using [vcftools](https://vcftools.sourceforge.net/) with the scripts [Calculate_TajimaD.sh](Calculate_TajimaD.sh), [calculate_Fst_vcftools_natural_stands_vs_cultivated_June_2022.sh](calculate_Fst_vcftools_natural_stands_vs_cultivated_June_2022.sh), and [run_xp-clr.sh](run_xp-clr.sh), respectively. The results of these analyses can be found in [Table S7](Table_S7_significant_values_TajimaD_Fst_XP-CLR.xlsx).

The average nucleotide diversity (pi) was calculated in the script [Calculate_natandcult_nucleotidediv.sh](Calculate_natandcult_nucleotidediv.sh) and organized for plotting with the script [calculate_genome-wide_nucleotide_diversity.R](calculate_genome-wide_nucleotide_diversity.R). The average nucleotide diversity, Genome-wide FST, and XP-CLR scores were plotted for [Figure 5](https://github.com/UMNKimballLab/WildRiceGeneticDiversity2022/blob/master/images/Figure_5.png)) with the script [Figure_5.R](Figure_5.R).
