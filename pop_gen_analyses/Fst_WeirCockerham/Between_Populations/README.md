For this analysis a filtered VCF was generated that included all natural stand populations and only cultivated varieties (excluding other cultivated germplasm) in the script [Make_filteredVCF_andgenlight_forFST](Make_filteredVCF_andgenlight_forFST). The FST values were calculated with the [stAMPP](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/StAMPP/index.html) package in the [Calculate_Fst_full.R](Calculate_Fst_full.R) script.
