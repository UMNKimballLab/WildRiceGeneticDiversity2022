UPGMA trees were made for all data (excluding the temporal data) for Figure S3 and the temporal data for Figure S8 separately. Reduced VCF files used for each were made in the scripts [Make_Alltree_vcf.txt](Make_Alltree_vcf.txt) and [Make_temporal_vcf.txt](Make_temporal_vcf.txt). Genlight objects and tree calculations were done in the scripts [UPGMA__genlight_and_tree_all.R](UPGMA__genlight_and_tree_all.R) and [UPGMA_genlight_and_tree_temporal.R](UPGMA_genlight_and_tree_temporal.R). The trees were both plotted in the script [Plot_UPGMA_trees.R](Plot_UPGMA_trees.R).
